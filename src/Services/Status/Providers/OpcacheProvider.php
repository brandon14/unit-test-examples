/**
 * Class OpcacheProvider.
 *
 * PHP Opcache status provider. Class will check to see if opcache is enabled, and if so return the
 * status array from opcache.
 *
 * **NOTE:**
 * We are not testing the functionality of this class. Sometimes it is hard to test internal functions,
 * and since this is a core PHP function so long as opcache is enabled, we check that opcache status is
 * available, and if so we get the opcache status array. According to the PHP docs, that either returns
 * false on failure, or an array of the status details, so if it returns false, we return a status of
 * an error, otherwise we return the opcache status array. If opcache isn't present, we return that it
 * is disabled.
